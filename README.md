# Careful what you say: The effect of a disinformation campaign on the 2013 Czech presidential run-off election

By **Martin Guzi** and **Štěpán Mikula** (stepan.mikula@econ.muni.cz)
We exploit a quasi-natural experiment that emerged during the Czech presidential run-off election to identify the impact of fake news on electoral outcomes. A~disinformation campaign associated a vote for one of the candidates with a legally and politically unfounded risk relevant to people owning houses confiscated from ethnic Germans after the Second World War. Using municipality-level data in a~difference-in-differences framework, our analysis suggests that the disinformation campaign affected the electoral outcomes and increased voter turnout in municipalities with the higher share of voters at risk of the unproven threat to housing ownership.
