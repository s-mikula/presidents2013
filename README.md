# Effect of Fake News on Voting Behavior: Evidence from 2013 Czech Presidential Election

In this paper we exploit a natural experiment that took place in 2013 two-round Presidential election in the Czech Republic to identify the effect of fake news on electoral outcomes. The fake news associated a vote for one of candidates with a legally and politically unfounded risk to property ownership of a specific group of voters and emerged between election rounds affecting only the run-off. We use municipality-level data in difference-in-differences framework to show that the fake news decreased the support for allegedly risky candidate while it increased voter turnout and support for the other candidate.
